   - Configuration for organizational access control

7. **Monitoring Capabilities**
   - Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry integration
   - Request tracking and performance monitoring
   - Error logging and diagnostics

8. **DDQ Processing Workflow**
   - Implementation of the specified workflow for processing DDQs
   - Question categorization and appropriate source selection
   - Answer generation with source citations

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

### Backend (Flask API)
- `app.py` - Main Flask application with API routes
- `openai_service.py` - Azure OpenAI integration
- `search_service.py` - Azure AI Search integration
- `sharepoint_service.py` - SharePoint connectivity
- `blob_storage_service.py` - Azure Blob Storage integration
- `document_generator.py` - DOCX document creation
- `system_prompt.txt` - Instructions for the AI model
- `test_app.py` - Unit tests for the application

### Frontend (Next.js)
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main chat interface
- `src/components/AuthProvider.tsx` - Entra ID authentication
- `src/lib/authConfig.ts` - Authentication configuration

### Documentation
- `deployment_guide.md` - Instructions for Azure deployment
- `security_guide.md` - Security implementation details
- `customer_documentation.md` - Solution overview for Hudson Advisors
- `sharepoint_integration_guide.md` - Guide for connecting to SharePoint

## Deployment Instructions

The application can be deployed to Azure App Service following the detailed instructions in the deployment guide. Key steps include:

1. Provisioning required Azure resources (App Service, OpenAI, AI Search, Blob Storage)
2. Configuring environment variables for service connections
3. Deploying the backend Flask application
4. Deploying the frontend Next.js application
5. Setting up authentication and security measures

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security measures:

1. Entra ID authentication for user access control
2. Azure RBAC and Managed Identities for service-to-service authentication
3. Secure handling of API keys and secrets
4. HTTPS enforcement for all communications
5. Monitoring and logging for security events

## SharePoint Integration

The application connects to SharePoint Online through Azure AI Search, which indexes the content from specified document libraries. The SharePoint integration guide provides detailed instructions on:

1. Creating an Entra ID App Registration with appropriate permissions
2. Configuring Azure AI Search to connect to SharePoint
3. Setting up the indexer for optimal performance
4. Troubleshooting common integration issues

## Collaborative Refinement Process

As documented in the customer documentation, this solution is designed to improve through collaborative refinement:

1. Users interact with the system and provide feedback on responses
2. The development team adjusts the system prompt and configuration
3. Document organization in SharePoint can be optimized based on usage patterns
4. The AI model's behavior becomes more tailored to Hudson Advisors' specific needs

## Next Steps

To fully operationalize this solution:

1. Deploy to Azure following the deployment guide
2. Configure environment variables with actual service credentials
3. Set up the SharePoint connection following the integration guide
4. Test with actual DDQ documents to verify functionality
5. Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement

## Conclusion

This DDQ Chat Application provides Hudson Advisors with a powerful tool to streamline the process of responding to Due Diligence Questionnaires. By leveraging Azure's AI and search capabilities, the solution delivers accurate, consistent, and properly sourced responses while maintaining a simple and intuitive user experience.

The collaborative approach to refinement ensures that the system will continue to improve over time, becoming increasingly valuable as it learns from user interactions and feedback.
